This directory contains code related to the parameter sampling
project. Still in making


(01) code_fitness.ipynb: Tests if the simulation is properly running a Monte
Carlo simulation. It produces a plot and two animations (very cool!)

(02) Investigating_angles.ipynb: Checks the dependence molecular potential 
angular terms have with respect to their parameters.

(03) Investigating_bonds.ipynb: Checks the dependence molecular potential 
bonded terms have with respect to their parameters.

(04) Investigating_nbparms.ipynb: Checks the dependence molecular potential 
nonbonded terms have with respect to their parameters.

(05) sample_parameters.py: Monte Carlo parameter sampling code.

(06) sampingtools.py: module with functions used in the sample_parameters.py.

(07) oemols_molnames.pickle: ordered oechem.oemol object storage file

(08) ref_energies.pickle: ordered reference molecular energies storage file

(09) topologies.pickle: ordered molecular topologies storage file

(10) s_E_mean.pickle: ordered energy uncertainty storage file (**)
